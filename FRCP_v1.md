# <a name="frcp"></a>Federated Resource Control Protocol (FRCP)

This document describes the *Federated Resource Control Protocol (FRCP)*, which 
may be used by any software entity for controlling and orchestrating distributed
resources, such as testbed devices, sensor nodes or measurement software. This 
protocol is currently used by 
[OMF6](https://github.com/mytestbed/omf)
entities, and may be implemented by any other software project to interact with 
other FRCP-enabled components.

This document is organised as follows:

[Protocol and Interactions](#proto_inter)  
[Generic Message Syntax](#syntax_msg) - [XML](#syntax_xml) and [JSON](#syntax_json) format  
[Inform Syntax](#syntax_inform)  
[Configure Syntax](#syntax_configure)  
[Request Syntax](#syntax_request)  
[Create Syntax](#syntax_create)  
[Release Syntax](#syntax_release)  
[Optional Guard Syntax](#syntax_guard)  
[Handling Groups of Resources](#syntax_group)

## <a name="proto_inter"></a>Protocol and Interactions

The basic protocol consists of a **message** being sent by a **requester** to a 
**component** (or **resource**). The component may accept the message and 
perform the requested associated actions. This may lead to further messages 
being sent to an **observer**. We introduced a separate observer to allow for 
different messaging framework. For instance, in an RTP like framework the 
observer is usually the requester itself, while in a publish-subscribe 
framework the observer is a stand-in for a publication.

![https://raw.github.com/mytestbed/specification/master/fig_overview.svg](https://rawgithub.com/mytestbed/specification/master/fig_overview.svg)  

The protocol consists of five messages:
[inform](#syntax_inform),
[configure](#syntax_configure),
[request](#syntax_request),
[create](#syntax_create),
[release](#syntax_release).
A basic interaction pattern is shown in the figure below.

![https://raw.github.com/mytestbed/specification/master/fig_interaction.svg](https://rawgithub.com/mytestbed/specification/master/fig_interaction.svg)  

For many implementation it will be impractical to create a directly addressable 
message endpoint for every component and we therefore introduce an optional 
**service address** (e.g. **aggregate manager**) for each component. The 
**service address** identifies a proxy which normally serves many components, 
requiring the message to contain the component id as well.

## <a name="syntax_msg"></a>Generic Message Syntax

FRCP messages can be described using either the XML or the JSON format. The remaining of this document will provide examples in both formats. The current schema definitions 
for FRCP messages FRCP are available here: 
[http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/](http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/)

###  <a name="syntax_xml"></a>Generic XML Format

The generic XML format of a FRCP message is:

        <MTYPE xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/X.Y/protocol" mid=ID>
          <src>RID</src>
          <ts>TIMESTAMP</ts>
          <replyto>TOPIC</replyto>
          ....     
        </MTYPE>

* X.Y = the version of the protocol (currently 6.0)
* MTYPE = the type of message, either `create`, `configure`, `request`, 
`inform`, or `release`
* ID = a globally unique ID for this message
* RID = a globally unique ID for the resource that published this message. Note 
that every entities are resources. Thus a software acting on behalf of a user, 
such as an experiment controller, will also have an unique resource ID.
In OMF6, this ID is in the form of a URI.
* TIMESTAMP = the Posix/Unix time in second when this message was generated by 
its publisher. This `<ts>` and the `<mid>` child elements are used to prevent 
message replays.
* TOPIC = optional. If the publisher of this message would like any replying 
messages to be published to a specific topic address, then it must set TOPIC to 
that address in the `<replyto>` element.

This element may then have child elements, which further describe various 
information specific to the message type. The following sections of this 
document describe each message type and provide further details on the child 
elements specific to each type.

In addition to these message type specific child elements, FRCP also defines 
two other child elements which are used in various message types. These are:

* the `<guard>` element, which carries constraint information. When this child 
element is present, an entity will only act on a received message if it 
satisfies the constraints described within this element. This `<guard>` element 
is described in more detail at the end of this page.

* the `<props>` element which declare various properties related to a message 
and which is described next.

FRCP provides an optional mechanism to verify that a given message was 
published by a given entity. This optional mechanism is described in the 
[FRCP Authentication and Authorisation document]().

#### The `<props>` Properties Element

Some FRCP message may include a `<props>` child element, which declares various 
properties related to that message. This is for example the case of the 
**configure** and **request** types of message as described below.

The properties and values within a `<prop>` child element may follow any of the 
three alternative syntax (i.e. key 1 to 3) below:

        <props xmlns:foo="http://foo.com/goo">

          <foo:key1 type="...">some_other_values</foo:key1>
          
          <foo:key2>
            <val>some_value</val>
          </foo:key2>

          <foo:key3>
            <val>1024</val>
            <unit>bps</unit>
          </foo:key3>

        </props>

* foo = the namespace (e.g. a given resource type context) for the properties 
defined within this `<props>` element.
* keyi =  the name of the i-th property defined within this `<props>` element
* The latter descriptive syntax for foo:key3 uses a list of child elements to 
describe the property in more details. Basic child elements are `<val>` 
and `<unit>`, but may also include `<origin>`, `<resolution>`, or 
`<min-value>`, `<max-value>` if the property is used as a constraint in a 
**request** message.

FRCP supports default namespace setting, thus the following message is also 
valid:

        <props xmlns="http://foo.com/goo">
          <key1 type="...">some_other_values</foo:key1>
        </props>


A `key` element may have an optional `type` attribut, which (if present) gives 
the data type of the enclosed value. Valid data types are: 
`string`, `fixnum`, `boolean`, `hash`, and `array`. The syntax for each of 
these types are as follows:

* **string**

        <foo:key1 type=string>my_string_value</foo:key1>

* **fixnum**

        <foo:key2 type=fixnum>5.6</foo:key2>

* **boolean**

        <foo:key3 type=boolean>true</foo:key3>  

* **hash**

        <foo:key4 type='hash'>  
          <keyA>value_for_key4_keyA</keyA>  
          <keyB type='boolean'>true</keyB>  
          <keyC type='int'>123</keyC>  
        </foo:key4>

* **array**

        <foo:key5 type='array'>
          <it type='fixnum'>1</it>
          <it type='fixnum'>2</it>
          <it type='fixnum'>3</it>
        </foo:key5> 

The behaviours of a FRCP-enabled entity which receives a **configure** message 
with `array` or `hash` property is described in the 
[Configure Syntax section](#syntax_configure).

[(jump to top)](#frcp)

###  <a name="syntax_json"></a>Generic JSON Format

The generic JSON format of a FRCP message is:

        {
          "op": MTYPE,
          "mid": ID,
          "src": RID,
          "ts": TIMESTAMP,
          "replyto": TOPIC,
          ....
        }
* The meaning of each fields is similar to the previous 
[XML syntax](#syntax_xml) above, i.e.
    * MTYPE = the type of message, either `create`, `configure`, `request`, 
`inform`, or `release`
    * ID = a globally unique ID for this message
    * RID = a globally unique ID for the resource that published this message
    * TIMESTAMP = the Posix/Unix time in second when this message was generated 
    by its publisher
    * TOPIC = optional, if the publisher of this message would like any 
    replying messages to be published to a specific TOPIC address

Similar to the above [XML syntax](#syntax_xml), the remainder of that 
JSON-formatted message may then have further objects, which further describe 
various information specific to the message type. The following sections of 
this document describe each message type and provide further details on the 
object specific to each type.

#### The `"props"` Properties Object

Similar to the above [XML syntax](#syntax_xml), some JSON FRCP message may 
include a `"props"` object, which declares various properties related to that 
message. This is for example the case of the **configure** and **request** 
types of message as described below.

The properties and values within a `"prop"` object may follow any of the 
three alternative syntax (i.e. key 1 to 3) below:

        "props": {
          "@context": "http://foo.com/goo",
          "key1": "some_other_values",        
          "key2": {
            "val": "some_value"
          },
          "key3": {
            "val": 1024,
            "unit": "bps"
          }
        }

* @context = the resource type context for the properties defined within this 
`"props"` object. Within FRCP this `@context` key is used to refer to 
the namespace within which the property keys are defined. 
    * In the current FRCP version the value for this object will always be a 
    string URI, i.e. current FRCP does not support or defined inline context 
    definition as specified in JSON-LD
    * Thus in the current FRCP version, properties within a "props" object are
    all defined under the same unique namespace, i.e. in the above example 
    `key1` and `key2` are from the same namespace.
* keyi =  the name of the i-th property defined within this `"props"` object
* The latter descriptive syntax for "key3" uses another object to 
describe the property in more details, such as `"val"`, or `"unit"`, etc...

The type of the value assigned to a `key` element may be any of the types 
supported in JSON, i.e.
`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `hash`, and `array`.

* **string**  
    "key1": "some_string_value",

* **number**  
    "key2": 12.345,

* **boolean**  
    "key3": true,

* **array**  
    "key5": [1,2,3,4,5,6]

* **hash**

        "key4": {  
          "keyA": "string_value_for_key4_keyA",  
          "keyB": true,  
          "keyC": 123  
        }



The behaviours of a FRCP-enabled entity which receives a **configure** message 
with `array` or `hash` property is described in the 
[Configure Syntax section](#syntax_configure).

## <a name="syntax_inform"></a>Inform Syntax

### Overview

A FRCP entity publishes an **inform** message to provide some information on 
some of its properties, which may have changed as a result of another message 
that it has previously received (e.g. a **configure** or a **request** 
message). In addition, a FRCP entity may also publish spontaneous or 
unsolicited **inform** messages to provide ongoing information on some of its 
properties. 

An **inform** message has the following XML syntax:

        <inform xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/X.Y/protocol" mid=ID>
          <src>RID</src>
          <ts>TIMESTAMP</ts>
          <itype>TYPE</itype>
          <cid>CID</cid>
          ....     
        </inform> 

Or alternatively the following JSON syntax:

        {
          "op": "inform",
          "mid": "ID",
          "src": "RID",
          "ts": "TIMESTAMP",
          "itype":"TYPE",
          "cid": "CID",
          ....
        }

* `TYPE` =  the type of this inform message. All resources must support the 
following basic types: CREATION.OK, CREATION.FAILED, STATUS, RELEASED, ERROR, 
and WARN. In addition, any resource may define its own particular types of 
inform message, following the convention BASIC_TYPE.SPECIFIC_TYPE. For example, 
if you have a custom resource which wants to return an inform message as a 
reply to a configure message that contained a syntax error, then that custom 
resource may define and use the custom inform type ERROR.SYNTAX.

* `CID` = this is the Context ID for this message. This element or object must 
be present only if this inform message is a reply to another message, in which 
case CID must be the ID of the original message. This element is not present in 
a spontaneous inform message.

An **inform** message may further have child elements (XML) or objects (JSON) 
specific to its type. For example, a STATUS **inform** message will contain a 
`props` element/object describing the status of the resource's properties. Such 
`props` element/object was described previously in the 
[Generic Syntax section above](#syntax_msg).
The next sections will provide more details on the different types of **inform**
messages that must issued by a resource as a reply to specific received FRCP 
messages.

### Usage

An FRCP-enabled entity:

1. may publish an **inform** message spontaneously to provide unsolicited 
report about some of its properties
2. should publish an **inform** message as a reply to previously received 
**create**, **configure**, **request**, or **release** messages
3. should publish its inform message on its main topic address (e.g. this could 
be mapped from its globally unique ID as is often the case in OMF6 resources).
However, if this **inform** message is a reply to a previously received message
which had a `replyto` element/object set, then a copy of this **inform** 
message must also be published to the topic address specified by that `replyto`.

### Examples

An spontaneous **inform** message issued by a resource with the ID 'node123' 
and the type 'vm' (i.e. virtual machine) defined at 
'http://foo.com/virtual_machine'. This example also shows the three alternative 
syntaxes to describe property values 
(see [Generic Syntax section above](#syntax_msg)).

* XML

          <inform xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/6.0/protocol" mid="48fa94">
            <src>xmpp://node123@domainA.com</src>
            <ts>1360889609</ts>
            <itype>STATUS</itype>
            <props xmlns:vm="http://foo.com/virtual_machine">
              <vm:os>
                <value>ubuntu</value>
              </vm:os>
              <vm:osversion>12.04</vm:osversion>
              <vm:ram>
                <value>8</value>
                <unit>GB</unit>
              </vm:ram>
            </props>
          </inform>
* JSON

          {
            "op": "inform",
            "mid": "48fa94s",
            "src": "amqp://domainA.com/node123",
            "ts": "1360889609",
            "itype":"STATUS",
            "props": {
              "@context": "http://foo.com/virtual_machine",
              "os": "ubuntu",        
              "osversion": {
                "val": 12.04
              },
              "ram": {
                "val": 8,
                "unit": "GB"
              }
            }          
          }

## <a name="syntax_configure"></a>Configure Syntax

### Overview

A configure message is published to a topic address to ask its subscriber(s) to 
set some of its (their) properties to some given values. 

It has the following XML or JSON syntax:

      <configure xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/X.Y/protocol" mid=ID>
        <src>RID</src>
        <ts>TIMESTAMP</ts>
        <props xmlns:foo="http://foo.com/goo">
           <foo:key1>...</foo:key1>
            ....     
        </props>
      </configure>


      {
        "op": "configure",
        "mid": "ID",
        "src": "RID",
        "ts": "TIMESTAMP",
        "props": {
          "@context": "http://foo.com/goo",
          "key1": ... ,
          ...
        }
      }

As discussed above in the [Generic Syntax section](#syntax_msg), the `props`
element/object may include several `key` elements/objects. Each `key` refers to
a single property of the resource, and holds the value to be set to that 
property.

### Usage

When a FRCP-enabled entity receives a **configure** message:

1. it should try to set its properties as described in the `props` part of that
message. More precisely, if `props` contains the key `foo` with the value `bar`:
    * if the receiving entity does not have a property named `foo`, then it 
    should publish back an **inform** message of type ERROR
    * if it does have a property named `foo`, then it should try to assign the 
    value `bar` to that property 'foo'

    * **About the Assignment of a Value to Propery**: 
        * when not advertised otherwise by the resource itself, *assign* in the
        general case has the meaning: "replacing the previous value X1 of type 
        Y1 held by property `foo` with the new value X2 of type Y2 provided by 
        this configure message"    
        * For example:
            * if `foo` previously held a value 8 of type number, and 
            the key/value `"foo": 23` is received, then the resource should try
            to set `foo` to the value `23` of type number
            * if `foo` previously held a value 8 of type number, and the 
            key/value `"foo": "Alice"` is received, then the resource should try
            to set `foo` to the value `Alice` of type string
            * if `foo` previously held a value [1,2,3] of type array, and the
            key/value `"foo": [9]` is received, then the resource should try to
            set `foo` to the value `[9]` of type array
        * Thus, FRCP does not mandate any type checking for properties. However,
        a specific resources is free to implement its own type checking or 
        casting as it sees fit, and return an **inform** message of type ERROR
        as a reply to a **configure** message with assignments that fail its 
        type checking
        * Furthermore, FRCP also allows a given resource to implement and
        advertise any custom assignment behaviour as it sees fit. For example, 
        when explicitly mentioned in the resource's documentation, it could 
        decide to:
            * set the value of `foo` to SHA1("Alice"), when it receives the 
            key/value `"foo": "Alice"`
            * set the value of `foo` to the array [1,2,3,9], when it receives 
            the key/value `"foo": [9]` and `foo` previously held the value 
            [1,2,3] of type array.

2. it must publish an **inform** message to its main topic address (e.g. 
typcially in OMF6 entities implementing FRCP, this would the topic derived from 
the resource's unique ID) to inform on the outcome of that configuration. This 
inform message must:
    * have its `cid` element/object set with the ID of the received 
    **configure** message (i.e. the value of `mid` element/object of the
    **configure** message).
    * provide in its `props` element/object the list of properties that have
    been modified as a result of the received **configure** message. This list
    of key/value properties should follow the `props` format described in the
    above [Generic Syntax section](#syntax_msg).

For some property the update from a previous value to a new one may take some 
time (e.g. changing the `filesystem` property of a disk resource from `ext3` to
`ext4` might require formatting, which would not be immediate). During that
updating process, FRCP defines an extended optional syntax for the `props`
element/object, which allows ongoing consecutive **inform** message to provide
progress updates about the configuration. This extended optional syntax is as 
follows for XML or JSON

        <props xmlns:foo="http://foo.com/goo">
          <foo:key1>   
            <current>V1</current>
            <target>V2</target>
            <progress>V3</progress>
            <msg>MSG</progress>
          </foo:key1>
        </props>


        "props": {
          "@context": "http://foo.com/goo",
          "key1": {
            "current": V1,
            "target": V2,
            "progress": V3,
            "msg": MSG,
          }
        }

  * `V1` = the current value of the property `key1`.
  * `V2` = the target value for `key1` as requested by the last **configure** 
  message. The configuration of `key` is assumed to be complete if and only if
   `V1` equals `V2`.
  * `V3` = optional, when present it is a progress indicator interger from 0 to 
  100, with 100 meaning that the configuration is complete (i.e. `V1` equals 
  `V2`)
  * `MSG` = optional, a text message with more information on the property 
  setting process


### Examples

These are some examples of **configure** messages and their corresponding 
**inform** reply messages, both in XML and JSON.

**example 1 (XML)**

      <configure xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/6.0/protocol" mid="83ty28">
        <src>xmpp://node123@domainA.com</src>
        <ts>1360895974</ts>
        <props xmlns:iperf="http://foo.com/iperf">
           <iperf:target type='hash'>
             <ip type='string'>192.168.1.2</ip>
             <port type='fixnum'>5001</port>
           </iperf:target>
        </props>
      </configure> 

      <inform xmlns="http://omf.mytestbed.net/omf/6.0/protocol" mid="d934l8">

             <ip type='string'>192.168.1.2</ip>
             <port type='fixnum'>5001</port>

## <a name="syntax_request"></a>Request Syntax

### Overview

A **request** message is published to a topic address to ask its subscriber(s) 
to publish information about some properties. This message has the following
XML and JSON syntax:

      <request xmlns="http://schema.mytestbed.net/omf/X.Y/protocol" mid=ID>
        <src>RID</src>
        <ts>TIMESTAMP</ts>
        <props xmlns:foo="http://foo.com/goo">
           <foo:key1 />
           <foo:key2 />
            ....     
        </props>
      </request> 


      {
        "op": "request",
        "mid": "ID",
        "src": "RID",
        "ts": "TIMESTAMP",
        "props": {
          "@context": "http://foo.com/goo",
          "key1": "",
          "key2": "",
          ....
          }
        }
      }

In the above message, the `props` element/object only contains the list of
properties (e.g. `key1`, `key2`) for which the current values are requested.

### Usage

When a FRCP-enabled entity receives a **request** message:

1. it should publish an **inform** message, which provides the current values of
the properties listed within the `props` section of the **request** message.
This **inform** message is similar to the one sent as a reply to a 
**configure** message ([Configure Syntax section](#syntax_configure))
2. it should publish this **inform** message to its main topic address (e.g. in 
the OMF6 implementation, this topic derives from the entity's unique resource 
ID)
3. if the **request** message contains a `replyto` element/object, then a copy 
of this **inform** message should also be published on the topic address given 
in that `replyto` element/object

### Examples

These are some examples of **request** messages and their corresponding 
**inform** reply messages, both in XML and JSON.
